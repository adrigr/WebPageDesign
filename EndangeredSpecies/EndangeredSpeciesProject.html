		<h2> Basic Information </h2>
		
		<!--1st paragraph-->
		<p> Saola's are cousins of cattle but resemble antelope. Saola is pronounced (sow-la).
		The saola's scientific name is Pseudoryx Nghetinhensis. They have 2 sharp parallel horns
		 that can reach 20 inches, white marks on their face, and large maxillary glands 
		 which could be used to mark territory or attract mates. </br> Saola's are only found
		 in the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. Although these creatures have two,
		 not one horn, they are often called the Asian Unicorn because of how rare they are.
		 The population is not known for sure but it is estimated that there is only 250-300
		 of these creatures.</p>

		 <h2> Attributes of a Saola </h2>
		 <!--1st list-->
		 <ul>
		 <img src="EndangeredSpeciesSaola5.jpg" alt= "photo" class="photo5" />
		 	 <li> High genetic and biological distinctiveness;there is
		 	 only one species of Saola in the world </br> so, much 
		 	 irreplaceable biodiversity rests within the genes of one Saola </li>
		 	 <li> Degree of endangerment </li>
		 	 <li> Paucity of conservation attention, compared to many 
		 	  other better known species </li>
		 	 <li> The ‘conservation flagship’ of a global biodiversity hotspot,
		 	   the Annamite Mountains. </li>
		 </ul>

		 <h2> Rarity </h2>
		 <!--2nd paragraph-->
		 <p> This animal is so rare because it is critically endangered. It is believed that
		 they are so endangered because of effects on their habitat and hunting.The forests
		 are slowly disappearing, causing the saola to have less and less habitat. Also,Saola 
		 often get caught in snares in the forest set for other animals like boar and deer.</p>
		<!--3rd pragraph-->
		 <p> The World Widelife Fund (WWF) is an organization that has been involved in the
		 protection of Saola's since their discovery in 1992. They have focused on strengthening
		 and establishing protected areas by helping the Vu Quang Nature Reserve. In the past
		 four years, they have created two new adjacent saola reserves in the Thua-Thien Hue
		  and Quang Nam provinces. </p>
