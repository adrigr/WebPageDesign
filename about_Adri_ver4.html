	<!--All about me-->
	<p> I was born on February 5th in a snow storm! Weird because winter is my 
	least favorite season. I don't like the snow and cold temperature. Summer is actually
	my favorite season because <b>I love</b> going to the beach, getting tan, going to the boardwalk 
	at night, and of course no school.</p>
	<p> I went to brandywood and hanby elementary then springer middle school before I came 
	here to Padua Academy, It was a big change from public and co-ed to catholic and all girls
	but It worked out.</p> <p> I play soccer and tried track once, I only liked doing the
	hurdles. My favorite food is sushi and favorite color is light blue. I like most music but
	my favorite genre is rap.</p> My favorite movie is <i> Saw </i> and my favorite quote is
	<blockquote> Get rich or die trying -50cent </blockquote>
